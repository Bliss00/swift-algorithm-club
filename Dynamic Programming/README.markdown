# 0-1 Knapsack 

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is one of the most famous problems in [Dynamic Programming.](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/) 

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that  the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. - Wikipedia

Given `KnapsackItem` items with corresponding weigths and values find the maximum total value in the knapsack by putting `KnapsackItem` items in a knapsack of capacity `capacityOfBag`. 

In other words, given array `knapsackItems` which represent values and weights associated with `KnapsackItem` items respectively. Also given an integer `capacityOfBag` which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of `knapsackItems` such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to `capacityOfBag`. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it ([0-1 Knapsack Problem](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-10-0-1-knapsack-problem/)).
